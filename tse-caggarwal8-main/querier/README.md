# Querier Module - TSE
## CJ Aggarwal, May 2021

I made no extra assumptions, and I, hopefully, built my querier as per specs.

There are also no known faults!

I believe that my querier is fully functional - i.e. that it does everything that is outlined, up to and including "print[ing] the document set in decreasing order by score, thus meeting the full specs."

I also understand that my gitflow practices have not been the best, but that is because I did not want to confuse TAs with only semi-working code after the deadline since I am submitting late. Hopefully this is understandable.

Finally, I used strtok which was recommended against. However, since it is only recommended against and not forbidden and my function works as expected, I figured it is okay to use it. I also attempted a solution using \0, but it was unsuccessful.
